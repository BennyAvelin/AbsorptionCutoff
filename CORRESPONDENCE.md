# Manuscript-to-Lean correspondence

A map from *Absorption cutoff and stationary singularities for rounded Gaussian
random dynamical systems* (Benny Avelin) to this Lean development, together with
an explicit ledger of every known place where the two differ.

The full dependency graph — 946 declarations, each carrying its `\lean{}` name —
lives in the blueprint (`blueprint/src/content.tex`); this file records the
paper-facing surface and the divergences.

## Headline results

Every one of these is exposed as an alias in
[`AbsorptionCutoff/MainTheorems.lean`](AbsorptionCutoff/MainTheorems.lean) and is independently
checked by `leanprover/comparator` against a Mathlib-only restatement.

The manuscript's metastability theorem has two logically independent
conclusions — exponential persistence as the dimension grows, and almost-sure
absorption in each fixed dimension. They appear as two separate aliases above,
and are audited separately.

## Coverage by section

- **§2, common setup and scalar estimates.** Complete for the routes §§3–7
  consume: the path-space absorption identity, the vector/radius reduction,
  invariant selection, stopped tracking, affine entrance, and the full Koenigs
  asymptotic.
- **§3, fixed-width cutoff.** Complete. The development proves the positive-drift
  first-passage central limit theorem and its canonical and post-floor forms;
  specializes it to the Gaussian log-radius recursion with its finite nonlinear
  correction; establishes synchronous rounded/unrounded coupling, entrance,
  restart, and post-entrance absorption; and derives the exact rounded survival
  and total-variation profiles, packaged as `HasCutoff` together with the
  manuscript's `O_ε(window)` mixing-time bounds.
- **§4, fixed-precision dimension cutoff.** Complete, including the
  rounded-vector lift and the mixing-time consequences.
- **§5, qualitative metastability.** Complete through exponential persistence and
  fixed-state-space almost-sure absorption.
- **§6, supercritical dimension cutoff.** Complete in scalar and reconstructed
  vector form, including the two-sided profiles and the `HasCutoff` wrappers.
- **§7, stationary singularity.** Complete for the full theorem stated in the
  introduction and for every fixed positive dimension. The development proves
  the Gamma-form characterization and uniqueness of the Cramér exponent, the
  positive coefficient, the directional limit on continuity sets of the unit
  sphere, and the radial limit. It also contains the stationary weak equation,
  the log-polar apparatus, the key renewal theorem and its Gaussian
  instantiation, the polar perturbation, and nonlinear forcing admissibility.

Two libraries were built in-project because Mathlib has no equivalent: the
positive-drift first-passage development behind §3, and the renewal-theory
development (renewal measure, directly-Riemann-integrable norm, Blackwell for
bandlimited kernels, and the key renewal theorem) behind §7.

## Divergence ledger

These are the known differences between the manuscript and the Lean development.
All of them are packaging or proof-route differences, or places where the Lean
result is *stronger*; there is no hypothesis in this development weaker than the
manuscript's.

1. **§3 is stated sequentially.** The manuscript writes the limit as `ρ ↓ 0`;
   the public `rounded_gaussian_nearest_cutoff` gives the equivalent formulation
   along every positive sequence `ρ_r → 0`, at the manuscript's exact floored
   `L_ρ = log(‖x₀‖₂/ρ)` time. It bundles the exact TV/survival identity,
   Gaussian profile limit, and same-scale `HasCutoff` conclusion; the former
   profile-only result remains available as
   `tendsto_tvDist_roundedPkernel_fixedWidthMesh`.
2. **The renewal route differs in two harmless ways.** Lean sends the terminal
   convolution term to zero using local finiteness of the renewal measure rather
   than a walk realization with almost-sure drift to `+∞`, and its signed
   key-renewal theorem acts directly on signed kernels instead of splitting
   `Ψ = Ψ⁺ − Ψ⁻`.
3. **The manuscript's measure/operator packaging is only partially mirrored.** The
   renewal capstone is stated test-function by test-function rather than as one
   theorem about a family of finite signed sphere measures. The explicit vector
   transition-density fixed-point equations of `prop:nd-stationary-equation`, the
   bounded rank-one transfer operator of `lem:nd-gaussian-transfer`, and the
   continuous-linear-functional packaging of `Ψ_y^π` are not standalone
   declarations, because the theorem route consumes the weak equation, the scalar
   transfer moments, and bounded test-function evaluations directly.
4. **Two §7 intermediates are omitted as objects.** Lean proves the log-polar
   stationary equation directly from `vector_stationary_equation` and does not
   define `eq:nd-linear-markov-additive` or `eq:nd-transfer-operator`.
5. **Forcing continuity is proved in a stronger form.** The manuscript asks for
   continuous angular tests; `continuous_nonlinearForcing` gives continuity in the
   radial level for every *bounded measurable* angular test.
6. **The supercritical hypothesis is encoded by the drift.** The manuscript
   writes `A > A_c(N)`, while Lean assumes `0 < A` and
   `Supercritical A N`, where `Supercritical` means that the logarithmic radial
   multiplier has positive mean. This is the defining characterization of the
   same fixed-dimensional regime used in the paper.
7. **The tail asymptotics use normalized convergence.** The manuscript writes
   the directional and radial conclusions with `\sim`. Lean states that the
   corresponding probabilities, multiplied by `s^{-β}`, converge to
   `c σ̄_N(B)` and `c`. This is the equivalent normalized limit when the
   comparison constant is positive, and it remains meaningful when
   `σ̄_N(B) = 0`.

On the continuity hypothesis of the key renewal theorem: the Lean proof
approximates the forcing in the directly Riemann integrable norm and therefore
needs `y ↦ Ψ_y(φ)` genuinely continuous, not merely a.e. continuous. The
manuscript's `lem:nd-gaussian-renewal` states that hypothesis, so the two agree.
It is not a restriction at the point of use: the only forcing the lemma is
applied to is that of `def:nd-nonlinear-forcing`, and
`prop:nd-forcing-admissibility` proves it continuous.

## What the comparator does and does not establish

For each of the seven theorems the comparator confirms three things: the solution
proves the **same elaborated statement** as the Mathlib-only challenge; it uses no
axiom outside `propext`, `Quot.sound`, `Classical.choice`; and the Lean kernel
accepts it. Both sides are built inside a `landrun` sandbox.

It does **not** establish that the challenge statement is the theorem you care
about — that is a human reading, and it is exactly the reading the challenge files
are written to make cheap. Each `Audit/<Name>/Challenge.lean` imports only
Mathlib and rebuilds its vocabulary from Mathlib primitives, so it can be checked
without reading the 70k-line development.
